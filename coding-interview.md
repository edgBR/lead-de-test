# Lead Data Engineer – Coding Interview

This document outlines the **Coding Interview** portion of the Lead Data Engineer interview exercise.

The purpose of this interview is to understand how you can lead and implement the development of data pipelines based on previously architected designs. Besides, the format of the interview will follow a driver-navigator setup. This means that a member of our team (driver) will be coding based on your instructions (navigator). This team member will behave differently during the interview meaning that:

- During the first 5 minutes he will behave as a total beginner in python/sql.
- After that he will have basic knowledge of the basics of the language (functions, classes, how to write CLIs etc..).
- At the middle of the interview (45 mins) you should assume that this team member knows about docker, cloud compute services, and certain design patterns and is mostly self-sufficient to do everything.
- The rest of the interview the team member will follow your instructions in a pair-programming fashion.

This test is designed to mimic what will be your role. We believe in close collaboration and sometimes we do this asyncronously (via PRs comments etc...) and sometimes syncronously via teams calls or VScode live sessions.


## Duration

**90 mins**

Traditionally, we have conducted this stage of the interview process offline. However with the advent of AI-coding assistance this has become unreliable as candidates with more available time, can do much more than others.

## Scope

You should select one or more components of your previously designed architecture in the previous session. However, to allow up for some innovation and to mitigate the effect of some candidates having more available time to prepare, your original design might be changed and tweaked at the beginning of the interview.

## AI assistance and test 

The driver will have access to GitHub Copilot Business. With the following models available:

- All Claude Models (up to Opus 4.5).
- All Gemini models (up to 3 Pro).
- All GPT models (up to 5.2).

## Notes

- During the coding session there will be one driver.
- During the coding session there will be an "observer" who will be taking notes and barely interacting with you.
- During the coding session there might be a "traffic controller", this role will be there just to help you ocassionally or to redirect you to a forward step in the interview in case that the team feels you have demonstrated sufficient knowledge on one topic.
- You can propose any tools, patterns, or architectures you believe fit best.

Thank you — we look forward to the discussion!
